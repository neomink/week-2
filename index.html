          The url used in prompt 5 has the full web address where the original image was located and also has the name of the image. However, one used for prompt 6, only has name of the image. When I opened each images on new tab, the url shown in first image was identical to one I used in img tag and the one below shows the location where this image was saved in my files. The one used for prompt 5 is an absolute URL and one used for prompt 6 is relative URL.

      <h3>Prompt 11</h3>
      <div>
        the link do not look the same as the button. I think it is because I have link element inside the paragraph element, which takes less space than the width and height I gave for the button, every thing squished.

      <h3>Prompt 12</h3>
      <div>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.apartamentomagazine.com/stories/radical-things/">
          To say that the world was restless between 1968 and 1969 would be something of an understatement. Cultural change and radical self-awareness played no small part in the contemporary history of postwar Japan. Technology existed at the heart of pitting the human body against the hostility of space. The US Apollo program was desperate for the 1969 moon landing to defeat the efforts of its Soviet counterparts. As the desire to escape the earth continued, a small group of Japanese artists made their temporal approach to object-making and painting even more extreme, with the view of making no ethical distinction between the man-made and natural, sending their own radical nature out into the world. Science and technology seemed to force things in one direction, while the quiet theory-led group known simply as Mono-ha pushed things the other way, deliberately transforming the avant-garde with a school of its own making.

          The css rule targeting li>ul also changed the color of li>ul in prompt 2 also, because css rule did not specified with class or id. When the element it targeted in css, all html tags will be affected.

          I first positioned the image center by using background-position, and changed the size of the image through background-size. I don't think positioning the image center did much, but I think sizing size of the image made the image fit to box perfectly.
